INTRODUCTION. XXIII

especially the Friars„ Let no man give them any temporal aicl3 if
they pretend to be in absolute want, let them work.

Some Friars condemn what they do not understand, like the
seven doctors at Oxford, who have condemned my doctrine of the
Eucharist. Though they clearly know nothing whatever about what
it is, they have proceeded to determine how Christ is present therein„
The Gospels all say that the 'oread is Christ⁹s body.

Wyclif again returns to the punishment that he wishes to be
meted out to these conspirators against Christ's law: alms should
be withheld from them. Each of the Orders hate the others, yet all
of them join to withstand him who would reform the Church. They
are like the Pharisees in Christ⁷s time, and answer well to the different
significations of the Hebrew word.

The Bishops (for Wyclif happens to return to them at the end
of the chapter) should give the people an example of poverty‚ of
spiritual chastity‚ and of obedience to Christ, but since endowments
have rendered it impossible for them to do so, they have gone wrong.
They commit injustice, trouble the State, blind the people, and are
disobedient stewards.

wishing the reader to notice how prone Wyclif is to repeat his con-
clusions‚ his argumentS, and osten his own words as regards his
great topics: the Pope, Church endowments, the Friars, and the Holy
Sacrament. And as he is always digressing into one or the other of
these subjects, a much briefer synopsis will suffice henceforward,
except as regards his theory of confession (chs. VIII—XII), and the
rebellion of the peasants (almost the whole of ch. XIII).

Ch. VII (p. 94—110) attacks the Archdeacons, their pride and
luxury, the slight fines that they inflicted for sins in order to get
more money, and especially the abuse of excommunication and
absolution. Excommunication, whether active or passive, may be right
or wrong according as both the sentence and the motive agree or
do not agree with God's law, but excommunication with bell, book
and candle is to be utterly condemned. There follows a rather fine—
drawn parallel between this practice and the doctrine of Transub-
stantiation. The people ought to excommunicate wicked priests by
holding aloof from thern, yet, as we never can be quite sure that
