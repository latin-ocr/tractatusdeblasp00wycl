INTRODUCTION. IX

We have more difficulty in getting rid of the allusions to the
Crusade in De Blasphemia.¹ It is indeed nowhere mentioned by name3
but the allusions to it are quite transparent‚ if we consider that here
was at the time no other movement — at once military and clerical
—— to which Wyclif’s language could with any probability refer.
These allusions seem therefore to have been made, if before the
Crusade„ only a short time before it3 not two whole years⁷ as the
date of the work stands by the preceding considerationS. We may
suppose that Wyclif himself, after having finished his work, added
a few remarks here and there in a later and (so to speak) revised
edition3 and possibly the sicut ducit eos ad cruciatum &c of De
[lpostasicg may also be explained in the same way.

One thing forcibly strikes the reader of De Blasplzemia: the
comparative violence ol' the language, when read after De Apostasia.
Wyclif was evidently deeply wounded, and the reasons of this feeling
are not difficult to discover3 indeed his repeated allusions to the
Oxford condemnation show clearly enough what they were. Yet he
never, even when indignantly protesting against the injustice of the
man who would burn him without hearing his defence (pp. 73—75),
descends so far towards personalitIes as to name the man to whom
he refers. And there is no advance in doctrine from De Apostasia
and others of his later works. In fact, the concluding sentences of
the book, —in which he declares himself ready, if need be, to retract his
doctrine of the Eucharist (p. 2873 see also p. 75), and merely says
(p. 288) that as to confession, he thinks it necessary, but believes that
Innocent IIl's decree was ill-considered, — seem to have been written with
studied moderatiori, in view ofa future citation at some tribunal or other.

The work, written immediately, or almost immediately after
De Apostasia, has a much more defined plan than the former, though
here, as everywhere else, Wyclif's digressive habits stick to him, and

¹ See pp. 156, 191, especially. We have even the word crucient on p. 156. Wyclif
cannot allude to the suppression of the rebels by Spencer, Bishop of Norfolk3 for in both
these passages hc· distinctly points to a foreign land (alienam ecclesiam . . . exteros).
