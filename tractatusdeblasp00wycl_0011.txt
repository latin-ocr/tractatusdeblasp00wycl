INTRODUCTION. V11

Throughout my work I have been favoured with the active help
of Mr. Matthew, whose assistance, on this occasion as with De
Apostasz'a, has been invaluable to me, and I feel that I cannot thank
him too heartily, nor indeed as heartily as he deserves. The encoura-
gement and advice of Dr. Furnivall, who prevailed on me to go to
Vienna, has also been of much use. Ι must not' forget to thank
Dr. Birk, the Head Librarian of the Vienna Hofbibliothek, for having
kindly placed the MSS. at my disposal.

Π. Anthenticity and date of the work.

Nothing need be said of the authenticity of De Blasphemia;
both external and internal evidence on this point are too strong to
leave us the shadow of a doubt. As to the date, Ι was at first of
opinion that it must belong to the latter part of the year 1383 or
the beginning of 1384. It was certainly written after De Apostasz'a,
which it several times quotes (see pp. 48, 202, 220, 224). Now, in
my Introduction to De Apostasia‚ p. VI. I had corne to the con-
clusion that the Crusade in Flanders was alluded to in one instance,
which sufficed to fix its date as simultaneous with that of the expedition3
and in De Blasphemia, pp. 156, 191, we find expressions that may
be construed as referring to the Crusade. I was indeed astonished
at the amount of work that Wyclif, according to this supposition‚
had found means to crowd into one year, but on the other hand, the
words Cruciatum langwidum infinitum seemed to me quite meaningless
where they stood, unless I took cruciatum to be a mistake for cruciatam.

But this hypothesis encounters a difficulty that seems quite
insuperable. Is is well known that the Peasants' Rebellion, under
Wat Tyler, and the violent death ofArchbishop Sudbury, took place
in June, 1381. Now, in De Blasphemz'a, Wyclif alludes to this
popular disturbance as having occurred quite recently3 and this
allusion is contained, not in one single ambiguous line, but in a
long digression, pleading for the rebels and excusing them as far as
possible (p. 190—200). Resides, towards the end of the work (p. 267)
he again returns to the same subject, using the very significant wordS, hoc
anno. “If this year³’, he sayS, “the rich clergy had offered to pay taxes
to the king for the poor, there would then have been no need to rev011.>³
