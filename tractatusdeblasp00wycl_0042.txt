XXXVIII INTRODUCTION. 'sl

But as ‘foreknown’ priests have not that power, we must suspect ³
that the water is not holy, if they do not follow Christ's law. Α ¹
priest who sometimes does wrong abuses his power,· if he continually
does wrong, he cannot abuse it, for he has none. We should treat
holy water with all due reverence (p. 259) yet without excess, avoiding
exaggeration on both sides. As for consecrated oil, its adulteration is
a very serious matter, since the oiI is consecrated by the Bishop‚ made
of costly ingredients, and used in Confirmation and Baptism: its
impurity would interfere with the integrity of those sacramentS.

Wyclif proceeds to point out the abuses concerning clerks
(p. 261—272). Some of them do not really, but only nominally,
belong to the clergy. But for such as do, the practice of employing
them in secular charges, is without excuse, condemned by Canon q
law, and a dishonour to the Church. It is said to favour the pro· ἱ
sperity of the realm, but it is contrary to Christ's law, and if the i
Canons forbidding it have fallen into disuse, that cannot be said of
the law of Christ. And a man willing to be a traitor to God, the
King of kings, may as well be a traitor to man also. It is impossible
to serve both Christ and the king properly. Christ's service has to
be abandoned. At least let them give up their benefices. This is
argued to be impossible, sor the King can only afford to pay them
by means of those benefices. Here again is an argument against the
temporal possessions of the clergy, an argument which the present
wretched condition of the poor tends to strengthen. It is incompre-
hensible how secular lords can rob the poor as they do, seeing that
the Iands of the clergy belong to them by right, and would yield
ever so much more than what the poor can give, and they would
thus regenerate the clergy, now so corrupt, so neglectful of the
people, so hated‚ and so unable to resist. Parlianient should pass a
bill to that effect, tallages should also be abolished, and the poor no
longer robbed. As matters stand, secular Iords are forced by circum-
stances to plunder their tenantS, and thus indirectly to ruin themselves3
and their own enemies move them to persecute the faithful as hereric-s.
The chapter closes with a petition in seven points to the King and
Parliament, summing up pretty nearly the whole of Wyclif's doctrine.

exposure of the misdeeds of questors ‘the twelfth sort of tormentors²,
