ing therefrom. Bishops now give curses instead of blessings, and
thus beget sons of the devi13 property becomes less⁷ a general rebellion
is impending, and all will be destroyed, unless God's providence
intervenes to save us,

The fallacy of false piety‚ intending to honour Christ's discipleS,
is met by the fact that Christ upon earth refused all such honour.
Friars excuse their high living by the good they do3 such an excuse
would be just as available for every possible excess. They justify their
splendid churches by Solomon's temple; that argument would give
every Bishop, like Solomon, a number of wives and concubines. To
excuse such scandals is to be worse than Iscariot; he at least affected
to think of the poor, when he reproached Magdalen: they do not.
When that poverty to which Friars pretend, is said to be indispen-
sable to the clergy, they cry, Heresyl and admitting that the same
man may be 3 member of Christ and of Belial, they grant that
Christ is the devil: an awful blasphemy. No ‘foreknowif can possibly
be a member of Christ, nor can one of the elect be 3 member of
the devil, though either may be for a time in a state of grace or of
sin. - There is a difficulty concerning this proposition (which is
quite Catholic, if we understand the words ‘member of Christ³ in
a peculiar way); for Wyclff, in one passage that Ι have not been
able to identify‚ though Ι remember it quite distinctly‚ denies that
a ‘prescitus³ can receive baptism3 and as, according to the usual
doctrine, baptism — either of water‚¹ fire or blood — is an indispen-
sable preliminary to being in a state of grace, Ido not see how our
author can consistently admit that ‘prescitus potest esse in graciam
secundum presentem iusticiam.³

Apostates are compared to warm water that efreezes more
quickly than cold‚ because its pores are dilated³‚ and Christian charity
which alone can save the people‚ is likened to the ointment on Aaron's
head (the clergy) which descended unto his beard (the temporal lords)
and even to the hem of his garment (the common people). And let
those who would hinder this union of charity lose all their property,

1 In the Trialogus (lV. c. 12) however, Wyclif admits that a ⁴praescitus] can
receive the baptism ‘fluminis' but not ssaminis’. This may answer my difficulty, but
it brings others to the front.
