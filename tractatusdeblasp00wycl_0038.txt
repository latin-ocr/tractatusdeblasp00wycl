XXXIV INTRODUCTION.

exactly the point of view of those who call the excesses of the Freuch
Revolution ea sort of wild justice.³ He points out the fact that the
clergy possessed superfluous riches; but he does not admit that they
ought to have been put to death on that account. Rather let thern
live, but be deprived of their temporalties. The clergy, who had
prompted the late war, were responsible for the great numbers of
soldiery in the country, whom they irritated rather than appeased
(pp. 191, 192). What had the Archbishop to do with the Chancellor-
ship, that most secular function of all? He was evidently a traitor¹
(p. 194). If the clergy does not reform, we shall yet see worse
disasters (p. 195). It must, however, be admitted that the punishment
inflicted was excessive: 151. In degree, the people having no right
to take away life. and. In quality. There was no form of justice,
only a mere outburst of popular indignation. 3rd· In manner, for they
did not punish according to the fault3 they rebelled against the
secular powerS, and they did not wait to take the advice of the
whole kingdom (pp. 196, 197). On the other hand, we must not
forget their grievances. Let neither the secular powerS, nor Rome,
nor the clergy, any longer rob the people.

Wyclif has not yet hinted at pardoning the rebels, but in the
answers to the objections that follow (p. 198—203) he shows his
purpose clearly. ,st- What Wyclif proposes would diminish the
royal prerogative. -— No, for on the contrary the patience of Christ
(paciencia maioris iniurie) increased His prerogative. So will it be for
our king too. 2¹¹d. Clemency would stand in the way of just punish-
ment. —— No, for God will punish them as they deserve, if they are
left to Him. Besides, let the possessions of the clergy make good the
losses of the secular lords, and we shall have compensation enough.
3sd. All fear of consequences would be destroyed, should the guilty
escape. -— Better filial than servile fear, replies Wyclif. Their punish—
ment will in any case, whether summary or judicial, be the cause
of much hatred and disunion in the kingdom. The king and secular
lords, and the clergy especially, have been much to blame in the
matter (pp. 200, 201). We should follow Christ's example of mercy.

who was accused by the rebels almost in those very ternis.
