INTRODUCTION. XXV

We shall see that Wyclif admits this; but then his theory of the
necessary person-al holiness of all priests whose absolutions are valid,
interferes with the practical working of his theory3 it is useless, even
hurtsul to confess to one who cannot give absolution. — All are
obliged to confess once a year, even such as have only venial sins3
not indeed ‘jure divino³‚ but jure ‘positivo‘‚ according to Pope Innocent’s
decree Omnis utriusque sexus (qu. VI, art. 3). But towards the end
of the article (ad tertium dicendum) it is remarked that, according
to some, the Decree is believed to have no bearing upon such as
have committed no mortal sin during the whole year. — This, as
we shall see, has direct relation to one of Wyclif’s many objections
to the statute of Pope innocent. —— The Pope himself cannot grant a
dispensation from the law of confession. He can only release from
the obligation of the Canon, not from the DiVine commandment3 for
it is ‘de jure divino² (art. ὁ). Confession must be made to a priest
(qu. VIII. art. ι), though in certain cases it may be made to a layman
with advantage (art. 2).—Wyclif and St. Thomas both agree on this
point, though for different reasons. The former seems (p. ¹48) to
think that an eelect,> thottgh a layman7 has the power to grant
absolution3 St. Thomas says that in such cases the confession is only
‘sacramentalis quodammodo,' the priestly power failing. - Only the
priest who has received jurisdiction from his superiors has the right
to hear confessions (art. IV). And here we may add, by the way,
that St. Thomas appears to be much stricter on this point than the
present custom of the Roman Catholic Church would warrant. He
even says (ad secundum) that it is not lawful to receive communion
at the hands of any other but the appointed priest. Certainly a
Catholic living in London might confess there in the evening‚ and
communicate in Liverpool the next morning, without being blamed
in any way. - Many considerations, and not only the grievousness
of the sin, are to be taken into account in imposing penances (art. 7)
Confession with contrition (or contrition with the desire and intention
to confess) delivers from the death of sin, and partly from the
penalties due to sin (qu. IX, art. ι, 2). The seal of confession may
οη no account whatever be broken (qu. XI⁷ art. 1). The confessor
may even swear that he knows nothing of the confession (ad tertium)3
for it has been made to him as standing in God's place. This rule
