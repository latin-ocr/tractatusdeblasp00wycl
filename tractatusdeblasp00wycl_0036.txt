XXXII INTRODUCTION.

many cases it happens, as a fact, that confessions are revealed. with
impunity3 as for instance, in sleep, &c Many inconveniences may happen
to priests who obey the law of secrecy. lt is a sacrament of the devil.
Confessors should, by the bye, leave public sinners, and not remain
their friends after a fourth relapse. Wyclif concludes by summing
up his doctrine on private confession, in which he admits the ‘power
of the keys’, but not as coming from Rome, through the Bishop83 it comes
direct from Christ, to those who teach the doctrine of Predestination.
The chapter closes with the solution of several other less
important problemS. 151. Can penance be done in a state of mortal
sin? No, for every deed done in that state is a mortal sin. Yet good
deeds are of service, they lessen the punishment even of the castaway.
2⁰⁶¹. It is of no use to repeat the same sins again and again in con-
fession. 3de Is the penitent obliged to accomplish the penance prescribed?
Wyclif here accumulates a number of difficulties which‘he considers
as insoluble from a Nominalist point of view. A penance is a uni-
versal, and therefore is nothing. 41¹¹. There certainly is a spiritual
affinity between the confessor and his penitent. St. Thomas denies
this quite as decidedly as Wyclif affirms it. If it were so, he says
the son of a parish priest would not be allowed to marry any of
the parishioners (Suppl. 5. Th.‚ qu. LVI, art. 2, Ad Octavum.) 5¹h. The
question whether former sins return when a relapse into sin takes place
is thus solved: As a ‘fore-known' is punished for all his sins, they must
necessarily return, but since the time and the act of falling into sin
are different, they are not absolutely the same sins as before. Roman
Catholic theology holds, on the contrary, that if at any time a man duly
repents of his sins, they are forever blotted out. (S.Th. 33, qu. LXXXVIII).
Ch. XII (172—188) attacks rural deans with much severity, and
points out the duties of Rectors and inferior priests. They are, if
perverse, the sixth, seventh, and eighth classes of ‘tormentors' The
rural dean's special duty is to impose fines upon such of the people⁸
as have fallen into the sin of Iust3 themselves prone to such sins,
they encourage harlots‚ in order that their revenue may not suffer,
like incarnare fiends. Their weapons are citations and excommuni-
cations. But they can easily be resisted, especially if the guilty party
resorts to his own priest. Their claim to inflict fines or to excommuni-
cate, after absolution has been given, is preposterou33 for the man
