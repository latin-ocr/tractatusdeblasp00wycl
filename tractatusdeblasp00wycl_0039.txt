INTRODUCTION. XXXV

Chs. XIV to XVII (p. 201—272) contain 3 vehement attack upon
the Friars, who are the tenth class of ct01·mentors³. We may pass over
these pages rapidly, 35 there is little new in them. Wyclif here, as in
De Apostasia (p. 29—31)‚ but at much greater length, complains of
the Ε1ῗ1131-1113116153, who went about recruiting rnembers for their
OrderS. Their advice may well result in damnation. We may advise
to do virtuous acts, but not acts that 316 indifferent, still less,
dangerous acts, as in this case, unless by special revelation. If the
state of 3 Friar is holy, 311 Friars are necessarily virtuous. It is
quite the contrary, though the possibility of their salvation is not
to be denied (p. 207). All that is said of the great graces given to
Friars entering, living, and dying in the Order, is false; and the
practice of putting on 3 Friar’s habit at the hour of death, is a
blasphemous superstition. They should, it is true, supply the want
of good parish priests, but even were they 35 fervent as in the
beginning, they are far too numerous, and burden the nation. They
often take heirs under age from their legal guardians3 an abuse that
should be punished by law, or by seizing the person of 3 Friar 35
3 hostage for the person kidnapped. They exhaust the resources of
the kingdom, and 316 practically independent of the secular powers.
Formerly poor and acceptable to God, they have degenerated3 and
now the results of the wrong they do 316 felt by every class in
the State. They 316 probably traitors and spies in every country where
they live. They obey no one. Their rule is blaspliemous, and can
be of no use to the Church but by being completely abolished.

It is said in their favour (ch. XV, p. 209) that they follow Christ
closely, 316 of great use to the Church, and therefore deserve our
respect. -— It is true that they live poorly, but that is not
sufficient to claim brotherhood with Christ. Robbers do the 531116.
They will not touch money, but they love it. The three principal
defects of their Orders 316, 1⁵1, that they live together without reason;
2¹¹5, that their communities 316 extravagantly rich, and 31‘d, that they
are excessively burdencd with traditioms. Their Founders would not
know them, they have nothing left of the Order but the habit.
Christ and His Apostles, far fron] burdening the country, worked
with their hands, -- A digression follows (p. 224—226) concerning the

saci-ament, containing nothing new except the sorm, in the assertion
