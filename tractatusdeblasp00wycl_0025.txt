place¹ not under his jurisdiction andin a matter which thou, babbler as
thou art! canst not even conceive? Most surely, I may retort, thou art an
arch-heretic (coronatus hereticus) unless thou showest that he is a
heretic whom thou thus blindly accusest.³³ This, Wyclif goes on to
explain, refers to his own views on the Eucharist, which he contends
are far more orthodox than those of his opponent. Yet that man
would burn him without suffering him to replyl And Bishops are
to be deposed for suffering heretics3 whereas Christ Himself suffered
Judas, and suffers tlzis apostate too!

Heretical prelates, he continues, ought indeed to be 111051 severely
punished, but not put to death by the Church; this would be con-
trary to Christ’s spirit of love. Scriptnre commands 115 10 avoid them,
the sentence of excommunication would be the very fact of a life
contrary to Christ's law; and 110 1601110131 succour should be given
to perverse members of the clergy, except in cases of absolute want.
Tithes ought not to be paid to bad priests, whatever the consequences
of refusal may be: the case of dues to be paid to secular lords without
enquiring into their lives, is by no means parallel. If secular lords
compel the faithful to pay tithes, 1116 clergy will 601116 10 consider
thern, not as alms, but as a right. The reason of all this backsliding
is our forgetfulness of the example of Christ.

Ch. Vl (pp. 80—94.) The Bishops form the third class of tor-
mentors of the Church; they have much degenerated, and want to
be again set in the right way by being discharged of the burden of
siches. Itis for the good of their souls; they cannot complain of
being unjustly compelled to do what is right, according to Augustine,
it is even 3 duty of charity to compe] 1116111. They cannot maintain
that the intention of those who first made the endowments was to
bring about the piesent state of things, or that the heirs have 110
longer any right over that which has been given away, since these
very heirs still appoint 10 1360611665 in many a case, and therefore
they still have a right to their possessionS. Those that 1131111 1116
clergy by endowments are severely punished by the evil effects result-

0 Lincoln, and is 3 marked instance of Wyclis's strong University feeling. The ssishop
was always claiming jurisdiction over the University, 11111611 1116 University disclaimed.
