VIII lNTRODUCTION.

lt is barely possible and extremely improbable that this is
merely an episode inserted into De Blasphenzz‘a, which may have
been written at a later date. Not to mention the fact that it fits
into the rest of the text quite as well as any of Wyclif's numerous
digressions‚ there is another argument in favour of De blasphemia
being written in 1381. We have an allusion (pp. 89, 247) to a recent
condemnation of Wyclif’s theory of the Eucharist in Oxford. This
condemnation is usually ascribed to the year 1382, May—November„¹
Now, Mr. Matthew2 has proved - conclusively, in my opinion —v
that the date 1381, summer, usually given to the first appearance
of Wyclif's doctrine on Transubstantiation7 is in reality the date of
his condemnation at Oxford. We have thus two separate indications,
each pointing to the latter half of 1381 as the date of De Blasphemia.

But if we admit this date, De Apostasicz, which was certainly
written before it, must also be shifted backward53 and how then can
I explain the ‘words cruciatum langwidum infinitum, and the allusions
to the Crusade in De Blasphemia? I must reluctantly say that I was
too hasty in taking three words as a sufficiently precise indication
on which to found the date of De Apostasz'a. Whatever its date may
be, it stands between De Simonia and De Blasplzemz'a, as it quotes
the former and is quoted in the latter work3 it was also written
probably before De Eucharisha, because, though its doctrines are
substantially the same, and it deals with the Eucharistic question in
fifteen of its seventeen chapters, no mention is made of that work.
And in De Apostasia Wyclif still holds to the term of Transubstan-
tiation, which he definitively rejects in De Euclzaristia (De Ap. 2103
De> Euclz. Int. IV). As to explaining the words cruciatum &c.,
I give it up. So far as I can see, they have no meaning. If Wyclif
intends to say that the devil leads his adherents to the torments of
Hell⁷ they would in one sense be ‘infinite'3 but ‘languid' is an epithet
that seems most misappropriate to such pains. All I can do here is
to suppose the text corrupt through some copyist's mistake or the

interpolation into the text of a remark originally intended as a
foot-note.
