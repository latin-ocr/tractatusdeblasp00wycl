stance‚ the destruction of the bread, contrary to all the ancient
Doctors of the Church,1 and the presence of Christ's Body in the
Host, with all its qualitieS‚ as in Heaven. ΞΜ Great absurdities. The
Sacrament is neither bread nor Christ's Body; or it is at the sarne
time Christ and the most abject of entities. In the Host, all the parts
of our Lord’s Body are mixed up together in ridiculous confusion3
according to those Doctors, the very impossibility of a thing is a
reason for our believing it. The theory of the multiplicatiori of Christ's
Body in different Hosts would place Christ above and below Himself,
&c. with infinite other absurd conclusions. The presence of Christ in
the Host by no means involves the multiplicatiori of His Eody, for
He is present figuratively‚ and a figurative ssody can be present
without multiplicatiori in many places. This view of Christ's presence
is preferable to any other, as it cuts short the idolatry into which
the people are too apt to fall.

Wyclif then (p. δι) proceeds to attack the Pope’s authority.
Here is idolatry again3 he is worshipped as Christ’s Vicar; this is
worse than the adoration of a piece of wood. Peter, Paul and Bar-
nabas allowed no one to prostrate himself before then13 if the Pope
exacts such honours to be paid to himself personally, he is guilty
of idolatry: of which we must purify the Church.

The first step towards such purification is to relieve her of the
riches with which she is burdened3 the influence of the priesthood
is diminished rather than strengthened by them: the inequality of
wealth that we see in the world is merely a punishment for sin. The
upper classes require riches and power, to keep up their temporal
authority; merchants may possess a moderate competence, but must
not charge too dear, and are, on the authority of Chrysoston]‚ advised
not to trade to foreign ports for articles that they would only re-sell
at a higher price. As for the clergy, it is absolutely necessary that
they should be free from all superfluous wealth, and receive as alms

1 Particularly to St. Thomas Aquinas. He denies, not that God can, but that
He does⁷ annihilate anything (S. Th. 1⁸, qn. CIV. art. 4); and on this account he
says that the bread, being changed into something better (Christ's Body), is not
destroyed (3²¹, qu. LXXV, art. 3); though indeed, as he admits that the substance
of bread is neither in the Host nor anywhere else, it is hard to understand whether

this is or is not more than a mere question of words.
