XXX INTRODUCTION.

As I remark in a foot-note on p. 152, Wyclif seems to confound
two quite different aspects of the enjoined penance3 and Ι
think it is as well to point this out, as tending more clearly to
show the Roman Catholic point of view, and by comparison, Wyclif's
also. Contrition, confession and satisfaction are three essential parts
of Penance, as a sacrament, and by ‘satisfaction’ the penance given
by the priest in confession is meant here. without the intention at
the moment of absolution to fulfil that penance, the absolution itself
is null and void, and to neglect, still more to omit wilfully that
fulfilmeut, is a sin that must be told in the next confession. So much
for the forgiveness. But it does not follow that there is no further
penalty to pay, because a sin is forgiven. That might indeed be, if
the contrition were sufficiently intense, but in most cases a temporal
punishment remains to be undergone, even when the satisfaction. i. e.
the penance has been accomplished. Now, so far as I have been able
to understand the Roman Catholic creed, indulgences bear upon satis-
faction only in the latter sense, not in the former. And if anyone
were to say that the penance imposed by the priest does away
completely with all liabilities incurred by sin, it would follow that
indulgences would be quite useless, for the penance imposed by the
priest is requisite to the validity of the sacrament, and can be dispensed
with by no indulgence, but only in a subsequent confession. If therefore
Wyclif understood it in this sense, he would be proving a thesis
against which no one ever said anything. On the other hand the
shortest prayer enjoined by the priest is considered sufficient to
render the sacrament valid. I of course do not allude to sins of theft,
for which the priest has no right to grant, nor the penitent to receive
absolution‚ without a sincere promise of restitution. There are also
other cases in which, if a peniteut does not make certain promises
to prove his good will, no absolution can be given.

Another digression follows, in which the Pope is severely
blamed for his attachment to temporal power3 Bishops who
are greedy for money, punishing sinners by yearly fines, are branded
as hirelings and wolves3 and a beautiful passage from Ambrose is
quoted, to the effect that, in order not to fear death, we must live
unworldly lives. Temporal lords, who are indifferent to the real good
of the Church, also share in Wyclif's general blame. Traditions are
