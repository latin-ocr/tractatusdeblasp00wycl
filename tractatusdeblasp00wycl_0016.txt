XII INTRODUCTION.

power.¹ Vows besides, adds Wyclif, speaking of perpetual vows,
often have the effect of hindering us in our duty and tying us down
to a beaten track.

Three objections are next refuted in detail. The facts that there
were sects under the Old Dispensation proves nothing in favour of
sects under the New3 Anselm, praising monastic life, spoke of men
who really observed the perfectior] of Christ⁷s law3 and vows have,
according to St. Thomas, the effect of rendering venial sins mortal
(S. Th. 2²1 2³e,qu. CLXXXVI, art. 9, ro).—— This quotation of St. Thomas
should however, be read in the origina13 he by no means admits that
this effect is caused by the vows, nor does he even grant that sins
committed through mere frailty become more grievous3 those alone
that are perpetrated tex contemptu³ become worse. — Vows that we
cannot keep ought not to be kept3 for God cannot command what
is impossible. Wyclif also shows that liberty is destroyed to a great
extent by the rules of the sects; a point to which he returns in the
last chapter (pp. 280 and seq). And as, notwithstanding his Deter-
minism, he is a strong upholder of individual free-will, this is a very
important thing with him. It would here be irrelevant to show how
his system reconciles free-will and Determinism (Omnia que eveniunt,
de necessitate eveniunt)‚· it would also take far too much space3 but
the working out of his system appears clearly in his philosophical
works, ofwhich I have had the occasion to copy some, and to collate
others.

1St Wyclif then, implicitly granting that the Pope has power
over the Orders, points out how that power could best be exercised:
by giving a general dispensation of vows to all monks and friars.
Such a dispensation‚ necessary for Christian liberty, would assimilate
the secular to the regular clergy, while it need not absolutely
interfere with the claustral life of such as prefer living thus. Should
the Pope hesitate to grant this liberty, God will grant it (pp. 14—15).
Authorities are quoted in favour of this view: Bernard and Anselm
use words that identify the profession of Christianity with that of

position that the vows of Baptism are the most solemn of all, and render all
others superfluous (p. 11).
