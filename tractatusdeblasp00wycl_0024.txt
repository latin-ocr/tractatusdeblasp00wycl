XX INTRODUCTION.

Wyclif's doctrine, it is argued, would ruin all Church endow-
ments. So it would. But there are in the world three kingdoms: that
of Antichrist‚ that of secular princes, and Christ's Kingdom. The abo-
lition of endowments would destroy the first, it is true, but would
be favourable to the others (pp. 68—70). Again⁹ it would do away
with all hierarchical distinctions·‚ but there would remain the inward
distinctions of personal holineSS. Excommunications would also cease‚
at least such as are pronounced for the sake of temporal gain, and
are prefigured by the treachery of him that sold our Lord for
money. Their frequency is in itself a good proof of the spirit in
which they are pronounced‚ and their disproportion to the
offence (for instance, those pronounced to avenge injuries in-
flicted on a Cardinal) is a crying scandal. The same may be
said of many other practices that implicitly assert the Pope’s universal
dominion.

Here Wyclif deals with the question whether all prelates are
heretics; a consequence that would seem to follow from his line of
argument. Many are called heretics‚ who are not. Christ himself was
called so. This is a point that God alone, not the pope, can decide.
But a certain prelate has imagined a new method of procedure as
to heretical doctrines3 the accused must answer simply ses or no
to all questions without any explanations‚ and ifyes, he is at once to
be burnt as a heretic7 and his bishop is to be deposed for tolerating
him. -— This sentiment clearly proceeds from some very fierce enemy
of Wyclif‚ probably a Bishop who had formerly been a Friar. It
is so flatly contrary to every notion of justice, that Ι suspect it to
have been only one of those unguarded sentences that sometimes fall
from the lips of oratorS‚ either in the pulpit or elsewhere. However
this may be, it is inveighed against in a passage of great energy
and eloquence. Judges may err3 no law —— except perhaps that of
Mahomet — could ever tolerate such proceedings. The idea of depo-
sing Bishops was no doubt first entertained by some apostate who
wished to get their sees for himself. Then, addressing the
unnamed author of the proposed, Wyclif exclaims: “O thou
hypocrite! . . . in thine own diocese there are thousands of heretics3
and how then canst thou dare to exhort a Bishop‚ under
penalty of losing his see, to condemn a man for heresy in a
