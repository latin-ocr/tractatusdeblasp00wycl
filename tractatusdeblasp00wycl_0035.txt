here worthless3 it is their duty to take all temporalties from the clergy.

Ch. XI (p. 157—171) debates 151, Whether public penance
is right. Many arguments are brought forward in its favour. Itis
grounded on better authority than private confession. If we confess
the same sins to several priests privately (which is allowed) the sin
becomes in a manner public3 and several priests can absolve one sin
at once, and therefore hear confession at the same time Wyclif
evidently leans towards restoring the severity of ancient times, “Eun''
says he, “no general rule can be laid down. We must consider what
is rnost to the penitent⁷s advantage.³' This decision may be contrary
to ecclesiastical law, but not to the law of Christ. Many think that
the Roman Pontiff should be obeyed in all things; whereas different
churches may have different customS. Some men prefer to communicate
on Easter Sunday3 others, on Maundy Thursday. Augustine advises
the faithful to communicate every week3 Ambrose inveighs against
Pharisaical observances in such matters. The Pope has no business
to interfere, and should be disobeyed by way of protest, as he
exceeds his power, even though he may command us to do what
is not wrong. God leaves us (p. 162) our liberty in a great number
of acts, Man has no right to encroach upon that liberty, or we
return to the bondage of the Old Law. Many other absurdities and
blasphemies also flow from this principle.

Wyclif now takes into consideration three objections lst· If
this doctrine be true, no vows are right. -— No, not when is is clear
that God no longer approves of thern. An action is forbidden by the
vow, because forbidden by God for atinae, not forever. An act, good
in itself‚ cannot be made criminal by burnan law. 2nd and 31'd. No
Christian can make laws, and the Pope has no power to grant
dispensations‚ on this hypothesis. — Not at all. Laws may be made, and
also dispensations granted, provided they are in agreement with
Scripture and do not diminish Christian liberty.

The second question (p. 164—168) is whether the secret of
confession should always be kept. Here Wyclif replies by a very
decided negative. We find mention of public confession alone in the
Bible. All sins will be known at the Last Day3 why not now? To
reveal the secret would injure auricular confession: a good result.
A confessor, knowing of an intended crime, ought to reveal it. In
