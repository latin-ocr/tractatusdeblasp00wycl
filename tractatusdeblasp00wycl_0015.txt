good one. — The relation between simony, apostasy, and blas-
phemy is then shown, as every mortal sin implies simony and
apostasy, so it also implies blasphemy. As a corollary, Wyclif at
once concludes that the root of blasphemy is in the Roman Curia,
because a rnan most unlike Christ is said to be Christ's Vicar: discord
between words and deeds is blasphemy, according to Augustine.
A powerful invective follows against the worldliness, pride, secular
pomp and effeminate luxury of the Roman Pontiff, whose life is in
all points a contrast to the life of Christ. The ceremony of kissing
the Pope⁷s feet is inveighed against. Christ, even in the glory of His
resurrection, did not allow Magdalen to kiss His feet; and the Pope
orders his cardinals to kiss his! The counsel of humility, ‘to take
the lowest place³, is utterly set at naught3 but at the Day of
Judgrnent he that acts thus will surely take the lowest place, Hell. Thus
the Pope has no right to such homage as Vicar of Christ (p. 7—9);
human traditions have nothing to do with holiness3 it is not necessary
to salvation to obey the Pope, and England, after the death of Urban VI,
would do well to throw off his obedience, follow any one who would
show himself by his works to be Christ's Vicar, and return to the
purity of primitive Christianity. True, difficulties stand in the way3
the opposite party is strong, endowments are a great temptation,
and all these abuses are of very long standing: but it is flat heresy
to oppose truth for such motives; the longer any abuse has existed,
the greater the evil becomes.

Wyclif then brings forward three heads of an accusation of
blasphemy against the Pope, calling the first Hidden Pomer. The
Pope has no rnore right to give dispensations, absolve, and grant
indulgences‚ than any other equally good priest. Dispensations in the
matter of vows, if the vows were wisely made, are null and void,
if otherwise, they are superfluous: a foolish vow ought not to be
kept. Here we may say that St. Thomas (S. Th. 2a 2³0, qu. LXXXVIII,
art. 12) has a very remarkable summary of the doctrine of his
Church on this subject, which is not so far from Wyclif's opinion
as might be thought. St. Thomas distinctly says (Ad 2m) that
a man who accepts a dispensation for a vow, without ha-
ving at the least a reasonable doubt whether his vow was
wisely made, is ‘guilty of sin: this considerably limits the dispensing
