XXXVI INTRODUCTIOR„

that the ‘Accident-theory³ is a heresy that blasphemes the Father‚ the
Son, and the Holy Ghost. Christ’s words against false prophets‚
who come in sheep's clothing7 δερ. are quoted and applied. The endowed
monks, of whom but little was said in the proper place, are here
blamed for their luxurious lives (p. 228). On p. 229‚ Wyclif replies
to a question that many of his sollowers must have put to him.
Since every good deed may be hypocritically imitated, how can we
know that any deed is really, i. e. morally, good? for it has often
been denied that the good done by monks and friars is any proof
in their favour. Wyclif in reply draws a distinction between a
iudgment that is only probable and one that is certain. Every good
deed certainly proceeds from a cause physically good, and may
with probability be judged to be morally good, if no evil accom-
panies it. We should consider the whole tendency of a sequence of
acts, and not judge private persons as we judge a whole Sect‚ nor
set consent in the same category as deed. And under these restrictions‚
we may affirm that the whole clergy, the Friars especially, are corrupt3
the latter being especially condemnable, because they flatter the Roman
Curia, and often become Popes or Cardinals themselves. ssut they can
truly exalt the Roman Curia only by obeying its laws, as embodied
in the Decretals.

A long extract from a sermon of Fitz—Ralph closes the chapter
(p. 232—238). Eight heads of accusation were brought by this ssishop
against the Friars. 1St Against their sule, they beg when they have
work to do and can do it. 2¹³d They do not follow their rule literally,
as St. Francis commands, but evade it by glosses. 3sd They preach
against the will of the Bishop to whom the diocese belongs, 41¹¹ They
ought not to touch money, but they have a man who goes with
them and collects it. 5¹³¹ They preach without being duly examined,
and the Friar who gets most money is sent to preach the oftenest.
ΘΗ] Against their rule, they enter monasteries and private houses.71¹¹ They
do not observe Holy Poverty7 but accept any quantity of small sums
from poor people. 8ῑΙῙ They wear costly habits, interfere in secular affairs,
and disobey Papal laws, particularly as concerns the burial of seculars
in their grave-yards3 whence it is likely that they lie under an interdict.

Ch. XVI (p. 239—255) continues to att-acl< the Friars. The
Pope ought to abolish their Orders⁷ which he can very easily do, by
