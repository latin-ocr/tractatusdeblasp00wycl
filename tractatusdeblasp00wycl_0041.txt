INTRODUCTION. XXXVII

means of a general dispensation from their vows. Wyclif avails him-
self of the objecti0n that the destruction of the {friars would put an
end to scholastic degrees in the University‚ to inveigh against the
Fratres pilliati, or graduates among the Friars‚ who, as it appears,
enjoyed certain privileges very likely to excite the envy of such of
their brethren as were less intelligent or (according to Wyclif, p. 244.
ll. 31—37) less fortunate than they: such as, for instance, exemption
from preaching, from the Choir, and from all acts of obedience
(omne quod sonat in obedienciam). So that, while they praise obedience,
they make it the greatest reward not to have to obeyl This is
unscriptural in every way, as is also the fashion after which their
General domineers over thern (p. 246). An ahrupt transition hriitgs
us again to the Eucharistic controversy, and Vv'yclif's condemnation
in Oxford, and the ‘Catholic Doctor' who spol<e in Wyclif's favour,
whom (in DeApostasia, Introduction)l have supposed to beWyclif himself,
though I am not quite sure of that now. It seemS, however, that this
hypothesis cannot be reasonably doubted. He more than once speaks of
himself in the third person ¹, and the arguments of the <Catholic Doctor³
melt into the text in such a manner that it is hard to see where
they end and where Wyclif takes up the argument for his own part. There
is no need to give the details of these arguments3 the most striking
of them have already been dealt with in De Apostasia. Wyclif
concludes that the Oxford condemnation was a temptation of Satan,
occasioned by ignorance of the interpretation of Scripture. (p. 250).

The rest of the chapter contains nothing new.

Ch. XVII (p. 255--272) assails the door-keeper‚ and by door-
keepers Wyclif means all those of the clergy who were not in Holy
Orders. Two points especially are to be noted in this chapter:
Wyclif's theory of Sacramentals (p. 257) and his protest against the
employment of the clergy in secular affairs, — It is complained that
the doorlteepers mix too much common water with the holy water
that they distribute. VVyclis decidedly admits that a true Christian
and a good priest have the power given by Christ to His disciples
to cast out devils (as is done previously to the hlessing of the water).
