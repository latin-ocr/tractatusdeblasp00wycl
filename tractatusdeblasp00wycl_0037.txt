INTRODUCTION. XXXIII

is innocent. If one of them can inflict a fine for a sin that exists
no longer, why not a thousand others? Parish priests should take no
notice of these wolveS, except to defend their flocks. Especially should
they refuse to publish excommunication against one who has already
done penance. Such fines are neither alms nor atonement; they are
unlawful, because arbitrary. They indeed, by taking the money, remove
the occasion for lust, but they cause other evils. Why should the
sinner pay fines to one worse than himself, and who deserves to
be severely punished?

The duty of the spiritual pastor is then laid down. He ought
especially to avoid sinning against his flock. If he leaves thern, it
must be as Christ left the angels in Heaven, caring for their welfare-
He ought to appoint a good vicar in any case, and never exact
anything superfluous. We may not demand anything as our due,
unless we work for it. The bad clergy is. like the Pharisees, given
to outward righteousness alone. No one (p. 182) should accept a
benefice, except for purely spiritual motives. The curate would do
well to go preaching about the country, or at least in his own
parish. He should avoid absenting himself on pretence of study,
and be quite free from public affairs. He has no right to anything
but almS. Tithes were exacted as dues only by the wicked sons of
Heli. They are due to the priest only by God‘s justice, not by legal
right. The best way to deal with a bad priest is to cut off his
income by having nothing to do with him. As sor the inferior priestS,
though too often worldly and given to the Iusts of the flesh, they
seem less rooted in malice than the higher orders of the clergy.

Ch. XIII (p. 188—203) is nominally against the monks, but is
in reality a plea for mercy, in favour of the rebels in the then recent
insurrection, who, it is known, were headed by the priest John Straw,1
whose exaggeration of Wyclif’s doctrines are notorious. Wyclif of
course blames the excesses of the people, and regrets the death of
Archbishop Sudbury (lamentabili conflictu, p. 190), but he considers
both the Archbishop and the other members of the clergy, who
perished with him, as richly deserving their fate. In short, he takes
