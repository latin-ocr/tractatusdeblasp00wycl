VI INTRODUCTION.

A (Cod. Vind. 4514) is described at length in Mr. Pollard's
De Officio Regis, Int. p. XXIX. Its untrustworthiness has obliged
me very often indeed to adopt the readings of Β and C. Ι need
hardly say that the spelling, even when not pointed out in the foot-
notes, is often at variance with the other MSS, but spelling is so
well known to have been thought little of by scribes of the period
that Ι have considered it superfluous to correct it.

B (Trinity College, Dublin, C. 1, 24), described as F in De
Apostasia, Int. p. V„ is a very good MS.; and Ι at first thought it
better than C. Towards the end of the work, however, I came to
think that C was at least as good.

C (Cod. Vind. 1343) is described in the Introduction to De
Apostasia, p. IV.

A full description of D (Cod. Vind. 3933) will be found in
Dr. Buddensieg’s Wyclg'f’s Polemical works, Int. pp. XXXI, XXXII,
and in De Officio Regis (Int. XXIX, XXX).

E (Cod. Vind. 3935) is described as Β in De Apostasia, Int. IV,
and more fully in Mr. Poole's De Dominio Divino, Int. XII, XIII.

The two Prague MSS. are also briefly described in De Apostasia
as C (C. 73) and D (III, F. 11), the former belonging to the Dom-
capitelbibliothek, and the latter to the University Library. So far as
I can see, the Committee was under the circumstances quite justified
in deciding not to collate them, although C. 73 might possibly have
turned out to be an independent source.

The MSS. C, D, E were partially collated, and A revised, by
Dr. Goldmann with extreme care and conscientiousness3 it was indeed
owing to this very care that the Committee were enabled to judge
that D and E might safely be set aside. My thanks are due to him,
and also to Drs. Beer and Herzberg-Franckel, who, throughout my
stay in Vienna, rendered me every assistance in their power, with the
greatest courtesy and friendliness. Ι collated B myself in the British
Museum; and perhaps it will not be wholly superfluous to note
here that Ι hardly ever took any notice of mere differences of spelling,
01? places of words when they did not alter the sense, nor even of

such variants as igitur for ergo, et for atque, ἃς. Idrew the line
only at the smallest difference of sense.
