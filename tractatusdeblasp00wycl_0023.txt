to the Church, they pervert the clergy, diminish charity amongst
them, and cause dissensions and wars. All this is through the folly
or the mistaken piety of some temporal lords who rnade these endow-
ments. They are responsible for all those blasphemies about the
‘patrimony of the Crucified², the authority to excommunicate, the
assumption of holding all power from Christ, whereas the Pope‚
pretending to be elike unto the most High', more nearly resembles
Lucifer. Unworldliness in the Pope is absolutely indispensable; the
King of Pride can otherwise never be conquered; the conflict is hard
enough as it is. Christ's deeds are no less explicit than His words.
He had not where to lay His head. Both reason and faith tell us
that riches are good only in so far as they help us heavenward;
which, if excessive, they cannot do. Let our luxurious prelates re-
member the Rechabites, and consider themselves as ‘Anathema²; for,
since they do not keep Christ's commandments‚ they do not love Him.

Sylvester's motive in accepting endowments was doubtless good,
yet he sinned, for the results of his acts have been most disastrous
to all Christendom. At present, if Christ were to appear unknown
and to blame the life of Church dignitaries, he would be burned
as a heretic or scoffed at as a madman: for Christ's followers are
thus treated now for doing likewise. According to Christ, the last
should be first, and the humblest the highest, not the proudest. And since
Constantine's endowment has done so much harm, it is the duty of
the secular prince to undo the harm done by a secular prince3 he
must refuse aid to bad priests, and humble the <head of blasphemy³.

Ch. V (pp. 65—80) attacks the college of Cardinals as the
second ‘conjugatiff of the daughters of the leech. Their name, taken
by syllables, is found to mean CARior DIabolz' NAtzts, LIcium Se-
wzinalor‚· taken by letters, it stands for Custos Apostcztarum Regni
Diaboli, Iuvans Nequissimum Ad Legem „Iudicis Sopiendam. A general
condemnationis then passed upon them on account of their essential
aim, which is to favour Papal pretensions. Their dignities are with-
out Scripture warrant3 Christ ordained none but priests and deacons,
all other dignities encroach upon the honour due to secular
powers, and spring from the love of vainglory. The college of Car-
dinals compares itself to the Apostles, if s0, it is responsible for the

present state of the Church‚ which is governed by the Cardinalse
