and ΒΜ, that his laws are above the Gospel — are attacked. Wyclif
argues against the first only, because, that destroyed, the other two
must go at once. As a fact, many Popes have been apostates. Election
neither gives, nor forces God to give the virtue requisite for the
elect to become Christ’s vicar: even Christ's electiori had no such
power in the case of Iscariot. Election aims‚ not (as it ought to do)
at choosing one os the elect, but at giving a purely secular position
to the man chosen. It is thus a source of great danger, leading men
astray for the most part, and giving them to believe that the Pope
is the elect of God. To elect a Vicar of Christ is tantamount to
declaring that a certain rnan is predestinate; which, unless in the
case of special revelation, is blasphemy.

These three principles destroyed by overthrowing the first of
them, Wyclif proceeds to substitute in their place and to prove
three contrary principles. 1⁵1, No rnan is more likely to be Antichrist
than the Roman Pontiff. Where there are more facilities for a man
to set himself up in Christ⁷s place, there is more likelihood that he
will do so. Such is the case with the Pope. 2⁶⁶³ The Pope is to be
believed only when his words agree with Holy Writ. His duty is not
to make articles of faith‚ but to expound Scripture in all humility.
3rd To follow any man rather than the GospeL is rank blasphemy.

From these principles flovvs a corollary. The different religious
Orders, having their being only by Papal statutes not grounded on
Scriptum, ought to be put down. That there are good points in the
present system proves nothing whatever in its favour. God’s law is
said to be the standard according to which the Orders act, but in
reality they care for nothing but their own traditions. This is a
dangerous practical error, for it is the source of all divisions in the
Church, each man seeking his own. But the root of all the evil was
the perpetuity of the Pope's approbation of these sects.

lt may be objected thatthe Church needs a Head. —— True, but
not a visible one. Christ is the Head of the Church3 yet it was
expedient that even His visible presence should be taken away frorn
uS. As we see now, visible Heads occasion schisms in the Church.
And we, as brethren, should avoid all dissensionS. St. Jerome, quoted
here, says that custom can change nothing in matters of faith3 that

a Bishop (or priest) may rank higher or lower according to his wealth,
