XIV INTRODUCTION.

declare the contrary. Neither the sign of Christ's presence nor a mere
accident can be identical with Him3 and if the consecrated Hosts differ
fron] each other in many things, how can they be all identical with
Christ? It may be denied that the people is infected with such an
error: but this is a question of fact, and easily answered. We cannot
consider it as a sufficient reply to say that we believe what the
Church believes, or that the dogma is not fundamental. Idolatry or
faith? that is the question, and we may not say that it is of slight
consequence. Others blaspheme, saying that the words of Scripture are
obscure3 but both the adversaries and the adherents of this system main—
tain that they are quite plain. Wyclif then, quoting from De Eucha-
νίετὶα, states his position: that the consecrated bread is Christ’s Body
figuratively‚ not naturally, sacramentally not substantially3 metaphori-
cally, not identically. —— I have dwelt at length, in the Introduction
to De Apostasia, upon the doctrinal meaning of Wyclif's Eucharistic
theory: what he says about it in De Blasplzemia brings us no new
light, and there will therefore be no occasion to add here any remarks
on the subject.

We should believe Scripture, he goes on to say, and care little
for what either the Pope or the Sects may affirm on this matter.
Pope Innocent's decrees1 may be wrong, and, infallibility depending
upon personal holiness, there is a strong case against that ambitious
Pope. Yet we should, out of respect, explain the decree, understanding
‘transubstantiatiow to mean ‘conversionf The Friars, however, take
it to mean annihilation of the substance of bread‚ so that nothing
remains but the accidents, of what sort, they are unable to say.
This is blindness. The accidents indeed remain in the act of our
mind that contemplates them, but the activity of the subject is lost
sight of, not destroyed.

The contrary hypothesis involves 1St Muclz dissimulation,· for
when Friars hear it said that we see Christ with the bodily eye, they
find it convenient to remain silent, they cannot even refrain from
subtilizing as concerns the essence of the sacrament of Baptism3 lucre
is the true motive of the dissembling of these teachers of lies, to
whom no Christian ought to give aid. 2¹¹³, False miracles, for in-
