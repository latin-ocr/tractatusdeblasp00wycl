XVIII INTRODUCTION.

but that all are equa13 and that one of the Apostles was set over
the others, in order to avoid schism.

All that is now changed3 pride is the source of greatness in
the Church‚ blasphemies are multiplied, indulgences are abusively
granted, new laws are continually made. This, even if done by
ignorance, does not excuse the doer53 the origin of this evil — tem-
poral possessions —- must be taken away from the Church, and the
clergy should feed their flock with the bread of Holy Writ.

Ch. IV (pp. 52—65) begins with a beautiful theory on the ultimate
aim of man’s being. He was placed in this world only to serve God
and to yearn towards Heaven·‚ to help him thereto, God has given
him the example of the natural sky, with its sublime influences over
our earth, of the Sacrament, in which terrestrial matter is lost sight
of, and of Christ's Humanity, which is merged in the Godhead; all
in order to foster within us the virtue of unworldliness. All heresies
proceed from too great attachment to things temporal, which is
increased by the devil, whom Wyclif calls a leech. This diabolical
leech has twelve daughters, ever crying Give, give: viz„ Popes, car-
dinals, bishopS, archdeacons, officials, deans, rectors, common priests,
monks, friars, doorkeepers and questor53 but our author notes ex-
pressly that he excepts from the number all such as lead a Christian life.

This division, coming rather late in the work, is nevertheless
as good as any that Wyclif usually employs. We have already seen
that most of what precedeS‚ from the very beginning of the work,
is aimed at the Pope, though of course with frequent digressions to
one side and to another. The rest of this chapter may also be said
to belong to the first of Wyclif's divisions3 so that the first ‘daughter
of the leech⁹ is dealt with, more or less directly, from p. 1. to p. 65.

How can we know that any man is a pseudo-pope? By his attach-
ment to earthly things, which has increased ever since the disastrous
endowment of the Chusch, accepted by Sylvester, against the spirit
of the Fathers of the early Church: witness Augustine, who distinctly
condemns the idea of a Bishop accepting money from a father to
the disadvantage of his son. Now in almost every case of endowment,
the giver has legal heirS, to whom the property ought to revert, and
Augustino either condemned all endowments, or was inconsistent.
These endowments besides weaken the secular power, so necessary
