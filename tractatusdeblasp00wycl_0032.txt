XXVIII INTRODUCTION.

a wicked priest, he no longer has the right1 to ordain. And if the ssishop
cannot ordain‚ then the priests he has consecrated are mere laymen.
Wyclif, summing up at the close of this chapter the principal
motives for his opposition to the law -— its injustice, its uselessness,
and the spirit of greed that prompted it, — says in conclusion that
it might perhaps be explained ln agreement with his own views, but
that he prefers to reject it simply and follow the law of Christ.

Ch. IX examines the necessity of confession to a priest. After
refuting several false notions about the time of its institution, which,
as a Church law, Wyelif identifies with the date of Innocent's decree,
he rejects it as such on the ground of superfluity. On the other hand,
he freely admits the necessity of confession in itself‚ as a law of our
fallen human nature. Oral confession is a necessary means to be
delivered from sin3 every natural want supposes the means of satis-
fying it; and deliverance from sin is the greatest need of man. As one
man ought to help another in his bodily wants, so he ought also to
do for the wants of his soul. Thus confession is to be read of both
in the times of the Old Law and of the NeW‚ though we nowhere
hear of auriculas confession. In the days of the early Church, however,
confession, whether public or private, was always free and zancon-
strained. It is this point especially that rouses Wyclif's aversion to
the law Omnis utriusque sexus. He indeed brIngs forward many
objections that would seem to imply opposition to the practice of
confession in itself3 but in the light of subsequent and most unequivocal
utterances‚ especially the declaration with which the whole work
closes (p. 288), we cannot admit that there was any such opposition.
He was certainly in favour of public, and also of auriculas confession;
but voluntary, not forced.

There are therefore three sorts of confession; one made to God
with true repentance3 this kind is absolutely necessary to salvation.
Another is made to man3 it is a law of nature, confirmed by Christ.
The third sort is a mere human Institution, rendered compulsory and
exalted into an absolutely necessary instrument of salvation. Yet even

away. It is unanimously admitted amongst Roman Catholic theologiam, that even
schismatical Bishops have the power to ordain.
