INTRODUCTION. XXVII

their not being able to decide what penance ought to be given, it is
certain that no amount of penance is sufficient in the sight of God.
God's mercy either does or does not make up for insufficient penance,
if it does, discernment in the priest is unnecessary, if it does not, we
must find injustice everywhere, different priests enjoining different
penances for the very same sin. It is useless here to fall back upon
the notion of expiation in Purgatory, for an insufficient penance may
result in sending the penitent to Hell3 and even if not, the sufferings
of Purgatory are the most severe of penalties. The very difficult science
of enjoining proper penances is at present abandoned, and arbitrary
penances are given; because, if the ancient canons were followed, no one
would confess. Yet what was once possible is possible even now.
The real motive of this conduct is worldly gain, these priests prefer
to impose fines on their penitents, and, like bad doctors, ought to be
hung. The law requiring the penitent to be alone, heretically implies
that God can possibly not be present, that no confession is valid, if
overheard3 and it gives occasion to sins of lust. Solus besides can
not apply to a woman.

Passing rapidly by the question of the seal of confession, to
which he objects more at length in another part of the work, Wyclif
points out the rigour of the law obliging every one to confess to the
priest hierarchically appointed. Why should we have to ask leave to
go to another, when we have good reasons for acting thus?
And if the cproper priest> alone can, according to the decree,
grant the required permission, it follows that his Bishop has
no right to do so, and therefore no jurisdiction. God gives the
right to hear confessions at the same time as He gives the priest-
hood.

No formula of absolution is to be found in Scripture3 all Christians
can grant absolution. The priest, not knowing whether his penitent
is contrite, is ignorant whether the absolution really takes place, or
no: yet he utters the sacramental words — perhaps a falsehood. If
the absolution is given provisionally, then the pardon is uncertain,
and any other man could give it just as well. Augustine himself says
that the absolution of a priest separated from the communion of the
Church is not valid3 this may possibly be true of the whole present
hierarchy. According to Canon Law, if a Bishop has once ordained
