XVI INTRODUCTION.

the tithes given freely by the rich, while the poor offer up
their prayers as spiritual tithes. For tithes are a duty that we
owe to God, not a source of merit3 if we wish to have merit,
according to Augustine's doctrine, we must put the other nine-tenths
of our possessions (setting aside what is indispensable for food and
raiment) into God's treasury under the form of alms, never forgetting
that nothing rightly belongs to any Christian, except in so far as it
helps him to serve God. This rule is too often simoniacally set
aside by the clergy, especially as regards the collation of benefices3
and it thus happens that prelates to whom the spiritual power is wanting
(precisely because they are proud of that power which God, withholding
from them, may give to an unknown priest) are set over the people.

After this digression, Wyclif goes on to examine the arguments
in favour of Papal power, especially as regards the Pope’s claim to
grant dispensations. He has no more right to the promises rnade to Peter
than he has to be called the light of the world; the power to
loose and to bind depends exclusively upon personal holiness. To
dispense validly, we must dispense according to God's will: but that
would require infallibility, to which the Pope cannot pretend. (It may
here be remarked that Catholic theologians, even now, though they claim
a certain amount of Divine assistance and guidance for the Pope in
matters of Church discipline, do not by any means ascribe infallibility
to him in that respect. But neither do they admit that infallibility
is necessary in matters of discipline.) — Wyclif states that this
dispensing power implies that whatever the Pope does is right, and that
he will be saved. Yet all his power consists solely in the agreement
of his sentence with God’s. As it now stands, it is very weak indeed,
as we see by the light of present events; the Pope, having no earthly
power, cannot open or shut the gates of I-Ieaven, and, unable even
to set up a friendly prince in a country to which he lays claim,
cannot possibly grant remission of sins and indulgences. Such great
power, if he had it, should be first applied to himself. The chapter
concludes with a warning both to layrnen and to monks and friars,
not to confide in the Pope nor uphold him,

Ch. 111(pp.41--51) is a short one. Three false principles, from
which the root of blasphemy springs - 1⁵1, that every Bishop of
Rome is Christ’s Vicar, 2¹³³, that he is infallible in matters of saith
