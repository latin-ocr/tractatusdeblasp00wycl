INTRODUCTION. XXXIX

men who went about the kingdom, it appears, collecting money,
and dispensing indulgences from Rome, whom our author accuses
of drawing rnore than AE1oo,ooo annually out of the kingdom (p. 274)
the epilogue begins on page 276. His opinions concerning the perfectior,
of the religious state are, he says, attacked3 but he defends them by
quoting Grosseteste. All private religionS, like civil governtnent, savour
of sin. lt is hard to be saved in them. Why prefer the foolish remedies
of men to those given us by Christ (p. 279)? In Christ's law no
ceremonial observances are perpetual, lt is that which constitutes
the difference between it and the rules of Sects (p. 280), Church
endowmentS, &a We deny that any hard and fast lines ought to
be laid down3 they often have absurd results. Christian liberty should
be maintained. It is impossible to bini oneself down perpetually to
do acts that may at times be lawful and at times not.

Wyclif's doctrine of temporalties is, he says, denounced, yet it is
necessarily true. His opponents have no right to bring the actions
of Saints as precedentS, until they do the works that those Saints

king should redress this abuse. T'ne parable of the unjust steward

does not contradict this explanation. lt is a sin for any of the clergy

poverty.

Finally Wyclif says he is accused as a heretic, not really on account
of his opinions in the Eucharistic controversy, but because of his
adversaries' rage about the two other points, He is, however, ready
to retract any error he may have made, if shown that is an error.
The contradictions of the different Sects are then briefly touched
upon, and Wyclif⁷s opinion stated once more. The Eucharist is
Christ’s body, “non substancialiter, sed supernaturaliter³³. As for
Confession, I have already noticed his declaration that it is necessary,
bnt not absolutely so, and his protest against the compulsory nature
of Pope Innocent's statute, which was not founded on the Gospel.

In conclusion, he says, referring to the three books De Simonia,
De Apostasict, and De Blasplzemia, that, should he have erred in
