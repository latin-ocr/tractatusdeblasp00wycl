INTRODUCTION.

Ι. The Manusoripts.

De Blasphemia is extant in no less than seven MSS, four
belonging to the Vienna Hofbibliothek, one to Trinity College‚ Dublin,
and the two others to public libraries in Prague. The Vienna and
Dublin MSS. have been lettered as follows: Cod. Vind. 4514 (A);
Trinity College‚ Dublin‚ C. Ι, 24 (ss); Cod. Vind. 1343 (C); Cod.
Vind. 3933 (D), and Cod. Vind. 3935 (E). As for the two Prague MSS,
the Executive Committee of the Wyclif Society has not thought it
necessary to collate them, on account of the very great delay and
expense already incurred in the collation of the others, as the
Reports of the Society have fully explained. The same reasons have
obliged me to dispense with the help of MSS. D and E after the
first two chapters‚ their readings (as will appear to any one who
examines thern with care) not seeming sufficiently important to warrant
any further collation. B and C are evidently the best manuscripts;
A, from which the copy was made, unfortunately proved to be the worst
of all, and moreover the copy came into my hands in such a state as to
necessitate a complete revision of the text. Ι shall only say that in
collating the Trinity MS. I often had to recur to that manuscript in
order to make out my text, and that the observations of Dr. Poole
on the copying of the MS. (A) of his De Dominio Divino (Intro-
duction, pp. XIV, XV) apply with such striking truth to parts of the
transcript of De Blasphemia, that I should not wonder if the copyist
was the same in both cases, Other parts, however, particularly towards
the end, were very fairly written.

A few remarks about each of the MSS. will suffice.
