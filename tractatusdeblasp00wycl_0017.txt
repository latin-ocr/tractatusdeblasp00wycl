monachism, and Lanfranc holds that we are quite justified in with-
drawing from a monastery where our salvation is in danger. Such
use of the Papal authority would be far better than commanding
angels and regulating things of the next world, as Wyclif complains
that ‘Pope Clement³ —— perhaps Robert of Geneva — had done in
a certain bull of his.

an The second head of accusation is False Wisdom, which is
very briefly disposed of. If the Pope possesses the power of the keys,
he must claim for himself supernatural wisdom in order to use them
properly, but facts sufficiently disprove this assumption, and it must
be made for all that.

asserted by the Popes to he indispensable for the good government
of the Church, and to be only claimed out of zeal and charity, is
affirmed to proceed from quite contrary motives‚ If it were necessary,
God would not allow it to be taken away3 and the Pope's want of
success shows that his temporal power, condemned by the life of
Christ, is displeasing to God. We should rise up and refuse to obey
him3 but the perils of such a course render it more prudent to stand
aside and await events. Wyclif darkly hints'at a miraculous inter-
vention of Divine Providence.

Ch. ΙΙ. (pp. 18--41) deals for the most part with the Eucha—
ristic question (pp. 31); it then returns to assail the authority of the
Pope. After complaining of the exalting of traditions, the abasement
of Christ's school, and the putting forward of evil doctrines under
the appearance of good, Wyclif exemplifies the latter in the case of
the Eucharist. It is idolatry to adore the visible Sacrament as God,
for it certainly is not God. It is adored under pretext of devotion:
idolaters may be very devout, but false devotion cannot please the
God of truth. The more abject the sign worshipped, the greater the
crime: now, the Host is, according to these men, nothing but a lot
of empty appearances, it is therefore the most degrading of all
idolatries. The people believe that the Host which they see is iden-
tical with Christ; and the Friars, wishing, as they say, to favour
popular devotion, allow this error to prevail, though their own doctors1
