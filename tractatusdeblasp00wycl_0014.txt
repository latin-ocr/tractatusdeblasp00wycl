X INTRODUCTION.

we may observe of him what was said of Montaigne, that the knows
perfectly well what he says, but does not know what he is going to
say'. Subjects that we consider as separate are connected in his mind:
from the authority of the Pope to the existence of the Friars, and
from each to Transubstantiation and endowments, the transition is
easy and frequently made3 and we often find that what is nominally
a head of discussion, and marked as such in his plan, becomes, so
to speak, a mere peg to hang a digression upon.

Wyclif, after a short definition of blasphemy, immediately
attacks its root (i. e. the Roman Curia) and then its branches‚ com-
prising the whole under the collective title of the ‘twelve daughters
of the diabolical Leech³, or twelve ‘tormentors of the Church (p. 54):
the Pope (ch. I to V), the Cardinals (ch. V), the Bishops (ch. VI),
the Archdeacons (ch. VII), the officials, to which is added a synopsis
of Wyclif's views about confession (chs. VIII to X11); the rural Deans,
Rectors, and inferior Priests (ch. XII), the monks (ch. XIII), the
Friars (ch. XIV to XVII), the door-keepers or clerks (ch. XVII) and
the questors (ch. XVIII).

Before proceeding to give an account of the contents of the
work, Ι may say that I thought it would be interesting to confront
Wyclif's doctrines with the acknowledged beliefs of the Church of
Rome. Readers are frequently puzzled, when lighting upon some
bold and startling theory, to decide whether the writer was bringing
forward some new idea of his own, or merely laying stress upon
some recognized doctrine of the Church. And for all such scholars
as know the enormous influence exercised then as now by St. Thomas
Aquinas, there is no need of my apologizing for having set face to
face the cDoctor Evangelicus³ and the ‘Angel of the School³.

Ch. Ι. Wyclif begins as usual with a short definition and
division of blasphemy. It is committed, 1³1, when we ascribe to God
attributes that are not His; 2¹¹d, when we deny His real attributes,
and gra, when we ascribe His attributes to creatureS. St. Thomas
(Summa Theologiae, 2³, 2²¹0, qu. XIII, art. ι, Ad 2⁷²²) gives this
division almost in the same words, but does not name the authors
from whom he takes itl, and points out that the division is not a
