INTRODUCTION. XXIX

this confession may be pleasing to God on the part of the priest, or
of the penitent, or of both3 and unless a parish priest is reasonably
suspected of sin, his parishioners should confess to him as often
as they need it.

Wyclif then, after a short digression about Innocent 111, the
Friars, and the Eucharist‚ answers three objectionS. 1⁵1. It is lawful
to compel men to do good. -— Yes; but such compulsion falls only
upon exterior acts, and the use of force is the duty of temporal, not
spiritual masters. 2¹³d. Hugo of St. Victor, ssede, Augustine and
Grosseteste all agree that confession is necessary to salvation. -— Yet
it is certainly not absolutely necessary, as many examples and
Chrysostom's authority prove, [liat only belongs to contriti0n3 human
ordinances cannot be compared with Christ⁷s law. We must avoid
both extremes: no confession at all, and forced confession. What the
above mentioned doctors say refers to the for’mer error.

3¹1³. There is (Ch. X, p. 143) no stri‘ct definition of penace,
as understood in the first or the second sense3 all is vague. — This
is denied, for the definition has been given already. What makes the
difference between voluntary and obligatory confession is, that the latter
is exacted in order to get money. Most priests only ask the penitent
whether he has paid his tithes. Rather consess to the devil than to
such idolatrous, leprous, simoniacal hereticsl Never should alms be
in any case given to the confessor, even should excommunication
ensue (p. 145). Let us abhor this tendency to submit to every
command, whether right or wrong.

A long quotation from Grosseteste follows, in which he gives
the cliaracteristics ofPenance: he speaks ofconfession, as Wyclifremarlzs,
only if and when it is possible. If we are truly contrite, God will
always absolve us, if we are not, even the Pope could not. Absolution
should never be unconditiona13 it is blasphemy for a priest to take
upon himself the sins of another man, especially for money. Augustine
says that every aggravating circumstance —— wlzo has committed what
sin, where, how often, 11⁷in lzow many and what persons, wlzydzow,
and when ψ should all be examined, and such penance given as
may serve to correct the fault3 yet we must not suppose that any
penance enjoined by the priest is a sufficient atonement for sins
that have been committed.
