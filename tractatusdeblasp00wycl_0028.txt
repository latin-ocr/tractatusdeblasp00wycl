XXIV INTRODUCTION.

a man is a castaway, it is lawful to communicate even with the
worst of men for their good. At present the greatest abuses prevail:
all excommunications may be raised or absolutions obtained for
money: the latter are given to robbers through fear. It is a proof
that neither is worth anything. Excommunication ought, (ist) always
to arise from a feeling of charity toward the person excommunicated,
(2¹¹³) never to be prouounced chiefly on account of a temporal
motive3 (3rd) God's law should never be forsaken because of hurnan
excommunications: they are then harmless thunderboltS. The duty of
the faithful is to remain steadfast, notwithstanding the intimidation
practised on both clergy and laity. If our persecutors say that obedience
is due to them, we affirm that it is due to Christ alone, and to such as
follow Christ. We resist their excommunications‚ in spite of the unjust
laws that favour them, and we shall appeal to the king, as we have
the right to do. This right they themselves implicitly acknowledge
by calling for the aid of the secular arm.

Ch. VIII nominally deals with the efifth tormentor², the official
whose business it was to obtain money by means of penance3 but
in reality it says nothing about him, ancl is completely filled up with
Wyclif's opinions on the sacrament of Penance. In order to under--
stand fully in how far he agrees and in how far he is in contradiction
with the Church of Rome, Ι must premise a few statements on the
Roman Catholic doctrine concerning this subject.

The sacrament of Penance is necessary to salvation, but
not absolutely, only hypothetically (S. Th. 3²³, qu. LXXXIV, art. 5).
No mortal sin can be remitted without, and all are forgiven with
Penance (qu. LXXXVI. art. 1, 2). Penance removes the eternal, but
not necessarily the temporal punishment of sin (art. 4, 5). Sins once
forgiven do not return, if the sinner falls again (qu. LXXXVIII,
art. 1). Penance consists of contrition, confession, and satisfaction
(qu. XC, art. 2). Contrizion must extend to all sins (suppl. 3³0 Partis,
qu. II, art. Β), is the greatest of all sorrows, and cannot be excessive
in itself, only in its effects (qu. ΙΙΙ, art. 1, 2); it may, if sufficiently
intense, remove even all the tempora] punishment due to sin (qu, V.art.2).
Confession is necessary to salvation ‘vel actu . . . vel saltem voto,
quando articulus necessitatis, non contemptus, sacramentum excludw.
—— Thus, when it is possible to confess, confession rnust be made.
