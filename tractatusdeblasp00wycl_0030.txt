XXVI INTRODUCTION.

holds, not only for the confessor, but also for all that may in any
way happen to hear the confession, and tlze Pope himself may not
grant a dispensatim] to allow a priest to repeat a sin told in confession.
The penitent alone can allow this (art. 4). Priests have power, but not
arbitrary power, to enjoin penances (qu. XVIII, art. 4). Bad priests have
the ‘power of the keys²‚ so long as their jurisdiction remain33 but not
even Saints have that power, unless they are priests (qu. XIX. art. 4, 5.)

We may now return to the synopsis of Wyclif's doctrine.

Ch. VIII (p. 110-128) examines and attacks the law Omnis
utriusque sexus,· Chs. IX (p. 1282143) and X (143—156) determine
to what extent oral confession is necessary, whilst Ch. XI solves
several other problems, connected with the Sacrament of penance.

Starting from the definition of penance as a sacrament by which
sins are effaced from the lzeart and expiated, contradicted by the
assumption that, according to the decree of Innocent III. «all the
faithful must, when arrived at the age of discretiori, confess privately
at least once a year to the appointed priest set over them, and en-
deavour to do the penance he enjoins them³³ (which implies that
penance includes confession and absolution), Wyclif attacks this law. First
of all, according to the Fathers, (Ambrose and Gregory, for instance)
this confession is not penance; for their definition of penance does
not include confession. Nor is it included, if we define Penance as
c‘a virtue by which we deplore sin²²; it is therefore a rite superadded
to what is essential in the sacrament,

It is not reasonable to force the faithful to confess once a
year ‘proprio sacerdoti³, for a proper priest is too often not to be
found3 the obligatior] is either too loose or too strict, since it obliges
to confession even those that have not sinned1, and does not oblige
even the greatest sinners to confess oftener3 the law, besides, takes
no account of exceptional caseS, of deaf persons, wandererS, ἃς. There
are also logical difficulties, for every instant a new year begins. And
it is impossible to remember all the sins of a whole year; but, if
they are not confessed in detail, how can a proper penance be assigned?
priests are now completely blinded, and unfit to be the confessors
of a true Christian3 they do not follow the law themselves. Besides
